## 🛠️ 1. What I Built
- **Summary**: I worked in Linux commands using git bash, data preparation scripts, and ruff 
- **Key Tools Used**: git bash, vs code, github

## 🔍 2. My Exploration
- **What I Investigated Further**:
  - I installed git bash,choco, make, and python code in downloads to run pip and then ruff


## 🤖 3. Use of GenAI (if applicable)
- **What I Asked It To Do**:
  - how to install choco
  - how to install python while I already have anaconda

- **What I Got and Did With It**:
  - installed the relevant files with help of chatgpt to complete portfolio of week 2
- **Risks or Misuses You Noticed**:
  - It was straight forward

## 💬 4. Reflection
- **How did this week’s work support reproducibility or deployment?**
- **What was most confusing or interesting?**
- To me the most difficult and cofusing part was Makefile. I had to test and run multiple times and check directory position. Aso, I had to rephrase to all: prep clean to run it. Initially I tried with putting clean in next line but it was throwing error. After hit and trial it worked.
